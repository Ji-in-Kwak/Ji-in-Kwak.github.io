Hi there! I am working as a Data Scientist at LG Electronics, specializing in analyzing data from home appliances to support data-driven decision-making and extract valuable insights. I have an interest for leveraging data analysis and deep learning to drive innovation across various fields, including home appliances, healthcare, transportation and so on. Recently, I have been particularly interested in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and LLM models, focusing on developing intelligent agents that can simplify data analysis workflows and provide practical assistance in business operations. I am passionate about creating AI-powered tools that can enhance productivity and decision-making processes by leveraging RAG technology to provide context-aware insights and automated data analysis solutions. Continuously exploring new technologies and ideas, I am dedicated to transforming complex data into practical knowledge that solves the industrial problems.

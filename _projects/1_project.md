## Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding and predicting traffic congestion propagation patterns in urban networks using advanced machine learning techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and statistical causality analysis. The research addresses critical challenges in transportation systems by developing real-time incident detection and impact prediction models.


### 1. Traffic Incident Impact Quantification
Developed methodologies to quantify the spatial and temporal impacts of traffic incidents on urban networks. The research identifies influential features that contribute to congestion propagation patterns, enabling more effective traffic management strategies.

### 2. Real-time Incident Detection
Implemented spatio-temporal Graph Neural Network approaches for real-time traffic incident detection. The system processes streaming traffic data to identify anomalies and predict potential congestion events before they fully develop.



## Technical Approach

The project employs a combination of:
- **Graph Neural Networks** for spatial-temporal traffic pattern analysis
- **Statistical causality methods** for understanding propagation delays
- **Explainable Machine Learning** for analyzing the impact of various factors on congestion 

## Impact and Applications

This research contributes to:
- Improved traffic management systems
- Enhanced emergency response planning
- Better urban transportation infrastructure design
- Real-time traffic monitoring and alert systems
